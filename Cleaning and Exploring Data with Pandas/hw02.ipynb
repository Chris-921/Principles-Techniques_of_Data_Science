    "For this part, we're going to explore some new somewhat strange syntax that we haven't seen in lecture. Don't panic! If you're not sure what to do, try experimenting, Googling, and don't shy away from talking to other students or course staff.\n",

    "For this problem we'll use the time component of the inspection data.  All of this information is given in the `date` column of the `ins` dataframe. \n",

    "**Part I:** What is the type of the individual `ins['date']` entries? You may want to grab the very first entry and use the `type` function in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part II:** Rather than the type you discovered in Part 1, we want each entry in `pd.TimeStamp` format. You might expect that the usual way to convert something from it current type to `TimeStamp` would be to use `astype`. You can do that, but the more typical way is to use `pd.to_datetime`. Using `pd.to_datetime`, create a new `ins['timestamp']` column containing `pd.Timestamp` objects.  These will allow us to do date manipulation with much greater ease in part 3 and part 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part III:** What are the earliest and latest dates in our inspection data?  Hint: you can use `min` and `max` on dates of the correct type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part IV:** We probably want to examine the inspections by year. Create an additional `ins['year']` column containing just the year of the inspection.  Consider using `pd.Series.dt.year` to do this.\n",
