# Principles-Techniques_of_Data_Science
** This repo only includes sample code written by Zilong. The project ideas are from the UCB data 100 class.
This repository serves as a platform for tasks such as data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. It further encompasses statistical inference and prediction. The primary focus of this course will be on fostering quantitative critical thinking, as well as imparting key principles and techniques required to execute this process. These principles include languages for data transformation, querying, and analysis, as well as algorithms for machine learning methods like regression, classification, and clustering. Additionally, the course covers the principles underlying the creation of informative data visualizations, statistical concepts related to measurement error and prediction, and techniques for scalable data processing.
